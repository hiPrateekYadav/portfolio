# Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). It showcases my projects, skills, and experience to potential employers or clients.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the portfolio website up and running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

  ```git clone <repository_url>```


2. Navigate to the project directory:

  ```cd portfolio-website```


3. Install the project dependencies:

  ```yarn install```


4. Start the development server:

  ```yarn start```
  
      This will launch the website locally, and you can access
        it in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Customization

To personalize the portfolio website, you can make the following modifications:

Update the content in the src/components directory to reflect your own projects, skills, and experience.
Replace the default profile picture (public/assets/profile.jpg) with your own photo.
Customize the styling by modifying the CSS files in the src/styles directory.
Deployment
To deploy the portfolio website to a hosting platform, you can use the following steps:

Build the optimized production-ready version:

  ```yarn build```
    This will create a build folder containing the optimized static files.

Deploy the build folder to your hosting platform of choice. Some popular options include Netlify, Vercel, and GitHub Pages.
